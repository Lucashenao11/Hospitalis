# Hospitalis – Backend

Hospitalis is a web-based hospital management system designed to support and optimize clinical and administrative processes within healthcare institutions.  
This repository contains the **backend REST API**, responsible for business logic, security, authentication, data persistence, and system integrations.

The project is developed as an **academic and professional initiative**, following **industry best practices**, **software engineering standards**, and **Scrum methodology**.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The primary objective of Hospitalis is to provide a **secure, scalable, and maintainable backend architecture** that supports:

- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Medical staff management
- Appointment scheduling and management
- Clinical information handling
- Future extensibility for advanced hospital modules

---

## 🧩 System Scope

Hospitalis is developed incrementally using **Scrum**, divided into multiple sprints.

### Sprint 1 – Authentication Module
- Medical staff registration
- Secure login
- Password recovery via email
- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation and security controls

### Sprint 2 – Core Clinical Management *(planned / in progress)*
- Medical dashboard
- Appointment scheduling
- Doctor availability management
- Patient basic records

### Sprint 3 – Advanced Clinical Features *(planned)*
- Clinical history
- Medical reports
- Prescription management
- Role-based access control

### Sprint 4 – Reporting and Optimization *(planned)*
- System reports
- Audit logs
- Performance and security enhancements

## 🏗️ Backend Architecture

The backend follows a **layered and modular architecture**, ensuring separation of concerns:

- **Controller Layer** – Request handling (REST endpoints)
- **Service Layer** – Business logic
- **Data Access Layer** – Persistence and repositories
- **Security Layer** – Authentication, authorization, and guards

The API is designed to be **stateless**, enabling scalability and independent frontend consumption.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

Hospitalis backend implements essential security mechanisms:

- Password hashing using secure algorithms
- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Generic error handling to prevent information leakage
- Protection against common attacks (SQL Injection, XSS, code injection)

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** NestJS
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Password Security:** bcrypt
- **Database:** Relational or NoSQL (configurable)
- **Validation:** class-validator
- **Architecture Style:** REST API

---

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

Each sprint includes:
- Functional testing
- Validation of acceptance criteria
- Security verification
- Bug reporting and resolution

QA activities are aligned with Scrum and documented per iteration.
